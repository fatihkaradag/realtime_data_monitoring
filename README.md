Project Title: Real-time Data Monitoring Dashboard

Description:
Build a real-time data monitoring dashboard that collects, processes, and displays data from various sources. This project will involve building both backend and frontend components, integrating with databases, and deploying the application using containerization.

## Technologies Used:

### Backend

- Language: Python (with Flask or Django framework)
- Database: PostgreSQL (or any other relational database)
- Streaming Platform: Apache Kafka
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes

### Frontend

- JavaScript Framework: React
- Data Visualization: Grafana (or any other visualization library)


#### Features:

- Data Collection: Set up Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion.
- Develop Kafka producers to send simulated or real data to Kafka topics.

##### Backend Services:

- - Create Flask or Django APIs to consume data from Kafka topics.
- - Implement data processing logic to transform and store data in PostgreSQL.

##### Database Management:

- Set up PostgreSQL database schema to store processed data.
- Implement CRUD operations for managing data.


##### Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:

- Develop a React frontend application to visualize data in real-time.
- Integrate Grafana or other visualization tools to create dynamic and - interactive charts/graphs.
- Implement features like filtering, sorting, and aggregation for data analysis.
- Containerization and Deployment:

##### Dockerize both backend and frontend applications.

- Set up Kubernetes clusters for container orchestration.
- Deploy the application on Kubernetes for scalability and reliability.


#####  Additional Features (Optional)

- Implement user authentication and authorization for accessing the dashboard.
- Add support for historical data analysis and visualization.
- Integrate alerting mechanisms to notify users about critical events or anomalies.
- Implement logging and monitoring using tools like Prometheus and ELK stack.

##### Benefits:

- Gain hands-on experience with building a real-time data processing system.
- Learn about containerization and orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Enhance your skills in backend development with Python and frontend development with React.
- Practice database management and data visualization techniques.
- This project will provide you with practical experience in developing a scalable and real-time data monitoring solution, which is a valuable skill in various industries, including IoT, finance, and e-commerce.
